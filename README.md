# Algorithms

I want to write my own algorithms to solve some problems.


## Game
### Condition
Petya and Vasya are playing a game: they take turns taking cards from the deck on which non-repeating positive integers are written (Petya always takes the first card). Players take cards one at a time from the top of the deck. After that, they compare the values recorded on the cards: the player who has less draws another card and keeps it. When all the cards run out, Petya and Vasya count the sum of the values written on these cards. The loser is the one who gets less money than the other player.

They are tired of manually pulling cards and comparing values. They asked you to write a program that will determine the winner based on the original set of cards.

It is guaranteed that for any test the winner can be determined unambiguously.


## Complex numbers
### Condition
Denote by **S(n)** the sum of digits of a natural number _**n**_.

We will say that a natural number **_n_** is complex if there is no such natural number **_k_**, that

_**n = 3k/S(k)^2**_

Find the smallest complex number.

## Sort

### Bubble Sort
### Reversal Linked List
